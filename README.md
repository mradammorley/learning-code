Lessons and examples for learning code

## 1. Variables: Your Coding Toolbox!

Imagine you're packing for a coding adventure! You need tools to store different things.

### Numbers: Like counting your steps

```python
steps = 20
distance = 5.2
```

### Strings: Holding messages or names

```python
message = "Hello!"
name = "Alice"
```

### Arrays: Like bags holding many things of the same type

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

### Boolean: Like playing true or false

```python
is_raining = true
```

## 2. Data Types: Choosing the Right Tool!

Each tool is best for specific tasks. You wouldn't use a hammer to write a message, right?

```python
steps = "five" # This will cause an error, steps should be a number, not text!
fruits = 5 # This will also cause an error, fruits should hold multiple items, not a single number.
```

## 3. Loops: Repeating Actions Like a Pro!

Imagine building a wall brick by brick. Loops let you repeat actions multiple times.

```python
Print "Hello!" 3 times:
for i in range(3):
    print("Hello!")
```
```python
Draw 10 stars:
for i in range(10):
    print("*", end="")
```

## 4. Conditional Statements: Making Decisions!

Imagine choosing a path based on the weather. Conditionals check something and act accordingly.

Is it raining? (True or False)

```python
is_raining = True

if is_raining:
    print("Bring an umbrella!")
else:
    print("Wear sunglasses!")
```

Did the robot find the key? (True or False)
```python
has_key = False

if has_key:
    print("Open the door!")
else:
    print("Keep searching!")
```

## 5. Functions: Reusable Blocks of Code!

Imagine having a pre-built robot dance routine. Functions are like these reusable blocks.

```python
def sing_hello():
    print("Hello! Hello!")

sing_hello()  # Call the function to sing
```

Remember, coding is like building your own world with instructions! Keep exploring, experimenting, and having fun as you learn!
